Early documentation:

FormUser.cs works as both an edit to users and to add new users. This has to be made properly clear during the program usage.

FormBuscarUser
  ListBox that fetches the values from the global user list. 
  PropertyGrid that shows the values fetched from the selected value in the ListBox. 
  Stores a tempEditedUsers that STORES THE USERS THAT HAVE BEEN EDITED during the current session in case they need to be fetched to be reverted.


TODO:
Context menu in FormPrincipal.cs to delete and or create
yet another button, this one to create a new user.
